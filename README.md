# 42-brew-script
Easily install brew without sudo in 42 school Linux machines, then you can install anything you want. If you install it in `sgoinfre` you can *really* install anything you want.

## running

Just clone this repository and run this script with `bash` from anywhere and it should work, default directory is `~/homebrew` and default .rc file is `.bashrc`, you can change this by editing the variables at the top of the script. 

After running the script restart your shell with e.g. `exec bash`, should be good to go then.
